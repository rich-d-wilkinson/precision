Description: Tests for non-binomial data, particularly in the case where the data have been subject to mortality 
  (equivalent to being left out at random). Implements the Bayesian model selection proceedure given in Wilkinson et al. 2013
  and the James and Meelis tests. Also calculates the R statistic.
